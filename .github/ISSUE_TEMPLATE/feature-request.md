## 😭 What problem does your proposition aim to solve?
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. For example:

> When I'm using a `foreach` loop, I can't get the next or previous element in my collection without having a separate variable or overly verbose code.

## 📝 How would you like it to work?
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. For example:

> I would like to be able to use a `LINQ` style method to get the next element, for example:
>
> ```csharp
> foreach (var item in collection) {
>     var nextItem = collection.NextOrDefault(item);
>     var previousItem = collection.PreviousOrDefault(item);
> }
> ```
