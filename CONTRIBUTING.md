### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you identify a problem with the project, [search to determine if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Mauve/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Mauve/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request with the proposed changes.

#### Labels
### Labels
Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.
- The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Mauve/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Mauve/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
